# Hangman-Project

###### Open and run Hangman.py in Python to play Hangman!
###### Objective: Guess the secret word represented by the given row of dashes by entering individual letters. Guess all the letters in the word before your guesses run out.
###### The program will automatically detect if your input is invalid or if you've repeated a guess and will not deduct the number of guesses if this occurs.
###### Enjoy the progression of the images of Hangman and have fun!
